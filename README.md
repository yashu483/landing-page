Odin Project- Landing Page

About Planetography Project---
This website was made for completion of project to build a landing page. At this point code may be messy or could have done more effectively, but we had this project after learning basics (foundation) of HTML and CSS only. Hence no advanced HTMl and CSS is used. We had a option to just copy everything shown in design to just complete the project or we could have choose any topic or niche and make accordingly, so I choose this topic.
